# Enter-the-MAGICKA

TODO: Look at https://github.com/JohnKapri/Java2DGame/tree/master/Java2DGame/src/game/gui , look at how he uses game states for pause menu and other such things.

Things to do (will organize later):
1. Get player sprites
2. Extend player class to create new character types
3. Create player abilities
4. Make movement mouse based
4b. Figure out what to do for pathing. Will there be any pathing for player? (probably not, if you hit a wall just stop movement?)
5. Create different game states - menustate, pause state, etc
6. Create health bar for player
7. Create enemies (maybe have an enemy tile map?)
7b. Figure out how enemies will path towards you
8. Figure out collision boxes and hitboxes - for projectiles and colliding with enemies
9. Add upgrades to character + abilities
10. Figure out how to let players "auto-attack" enemies?
