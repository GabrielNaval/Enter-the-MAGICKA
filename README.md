# Enter-the-MAGICKA

TODO: Look at https://github.com/JohnKapri/Java2DGame/tree/master/Java2DGame/src/game/gui , look at how he uses game states for pause menu and other such things.

TODO (will organize later):
* Make the actual sprites smaller i.e. make the sprites not scale with container size
* Way point marker when you click? 
  * Change cursor in canvas (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1984071/how-to-hide-cursor-in-a-swing-application)
* Adjust so when player moves, the player's body is actually centered at where they click.
* Get player sprites
* Extend player class to create new character types
* Create player abilities
* Figure out what to do for pathing. Will there be any pathing for player? (probably not, if you hit a wall just stop movement?)
* Create different game states - menustate, pause state, etc
* Create health bar for player
* Create enemies (maybe have an enemy tile map?)
  * Figure out how enemies will path towards you
* Figure out collision boxes and hitboxes - for projectiles and colliding with enemies
* Add upgrades to character + abilities
* Figure out how to let players "auto-attack" enemies?

Completed

~~* Make movement mouse based~~
